# Project Synapse: Agentic Last-Mile Coordinator

> **🎉 COMPLETE SOLUTION**: Full-stack AI delivery coordination system with Next.js frontend and MCP integration!

Project Synapse is a sophisticated autonomous AI agent designed to intelligently resolve real-time, last-mile delivery disruptions. This version includes a beautiful Next.js frontend, Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, and comprehensive tooling for delivery coordination.

## 🌐 Live Demo

- **🤖 MCP Server**: [Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces](https://abhash-chakraborty-synapse.hf.space)
- **🎨 Frontend**: [Deployed on Vercel](https://project-synapse-frontend.vercel.app)

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy MCP Server to Hugging Face Spaces

1. **Create a new Space on Hugging Face**:
   - Go to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
   - Click "Create new Space"
   - Choose "Docker" as the Space SDK
   - Set visibility to "Public"

   ```

3. **Configure environment variables** in your Space settings:
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google Generative AI API key
   - `PORT`: 7860 (default for HF Spaces)

### Deploy Frontend to Vercel

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy with Vercel**:

   cd frontend
   vercel
   ```

3. **Or connect your GitHub repository** to Vercel for automatic deployments:
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click "Import Project"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set build settings:
     - Framework: Next.js
     - Root Directory: `frontend`
     - Build Command: `npm run build`
     - Output Directory: `.next`

### Environment Variables for Frontend

Set these in your Vercel project settings:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MCP_SERVER_URL`: URL of your deployed MCP server

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Manual Start
```bash
# 1. Start MCP Server
python -m src.mcp.server

# 2. Start Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### CLI Only
```bash
python -m src.main
```

## 🎨 Frontend Features

The Next.js frontend provides a comprehensive interface for monitoring and interacting with the AI agent:

### Dashboard View
The project features a comprehensive dashboard that provides a real-time overview of the system's performance and key metrics.

![Project Synapse Dashboard](frontend/screenshots/dashboard.jpg)

- **📊 Performance Metrics**: Real-time KPIs and success rates
- **📈 Tool Usage Analytics**: Visualization of most-used tools
- **🔄 Activity Monitor**: Live feed of system events
- **⚡ System Health**: Server status and performance indicators

### Agent Interface 
The core of Project Synapse is the AI Agent Interface, where you can describe a delivery disruption scenario and watch the AI agent work through it.

![AI Agent Interface](frontend/screenshots/agent-interface.jpg)
 
- **🤖 Interactive Testing**: Submit custom delivery scenarios
- **📝 Reasoning Display**: See the agent's thought process
- **🔧 Tool Execution**: Watch tools being used in real-time
- **📋 Pre-built Scenarios**: Test common disruption cases

### Execution History and Agent Reasoning

The system keeps a detailed log of each case, including the AI's reasoning and the specific actions it took to resolve the issue. This helps in understanding and auditing the agent's behavior.

![Execution History](frontend/screenshots/execution-history.jpg)

In the example above, a customer's delivery was marked as 'failed'. The AI agent's plan was to:

-  **Verify the delivery attempt:** Check the driver's location and other data to confirm what happened.
-  **Notify the customer:** Proactively reach out to the customer to reschedule the delivery, providing a clear and helpful message.

### Sample Scenarios Available
- Restaurant overload with long prep times
- Damaged packaging disputes at delivery
- Recipient unavailability for valuable packages
- Traffic obstructions blocking delivery routes
